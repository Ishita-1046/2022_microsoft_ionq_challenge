_Quantum Emblem_
==========

*What is "Quantum Emblem"?*
---------------

Quantum Emblem is a strategy game which aims to be a make players understand the logic of entanglement event between the qubits and use it to entangle players as a advantage in fights.
It is written in Python with Pygame.

*Description:*
--------

The basic behind our game is to make players learn and use quantum entanglement. However, the twist here is the players will be using entanglement on each other, not qubits, and transport in the needed times of the fight!

Quantum Emblem comes with lots of cool features:

Freedom to entangle players.
Options to tweak the code design to include more i.e higher the scores of your attributes, higher chances for you to transport!
Quantum Circuit ideas for future versions.

*Instructions:*
------

There are two teams: Squadra Blue and Squadra Rossa

- ![#1589F0](https://via.placeholder.com/15/1589F0/000000?text=+) `Squadra Blue` team is made up of boss, skeleton, and soldier.

- ![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/000000?text=+) `Squadra Rossa` team is made up of pirate tux, pirate, and ninja.

Between the fights, units can select the button “Entangle” and choose an unit they want to switch places with. This way, they can teleport to the other units’ coordinate and survive from the attack!

*Our team's personal experience at MIT iQuHACK 2022:*
---------

Our team consists of five people from different backgrounds with different levels of experience in Quantum Computing. We have a high school senior, two undergrads, and two early-career professionals. iQuHack 2022 was a unique experience for all of us. While a couple of us had participated in Quantum Computing Hackathons before, others were new to the scene. We met some of our team members through Slack and others through the Gather event. Working on building a Quantum-themed game as a part of the Microsoft/Ion-Q challenge was a fun and refreshing experience for all of us. Developing and fine-tuning the idea, building the GUI, and preparing documentation all in 26 hours is a hasty and stressful process but we got to learn a lot from each other as well as the mentors.

How to play
